PREFACE

Tun present edition of the Thinummua one of the most
popular of Latin plays, as well as one of the best for college
use, has been prepared in accordance with the general plan
of this Series. It aims at giving such help as will be needed
hythe young student when he first grapples with a Latin
comedy. At the sarne tirne, great care hasbeen taken to
introduce no reading or interpretation which is not in har·
mony with the best Plautino scholarship of today.

In preparing the hook, Ι have consulted nrost of the great
editors of Plautus, but I am under special obligations to
Leo and Lindsay‚ with whose texts this will be found to be
in substantial agreement. All importantdifferences between
Leo and Lindsay, as well as my few variatione from them,
are recorded in the Appendix.

Ι beg to acknowledge my indebtedness to lllessrs. Allyn
and Bacon for kind perinission to reproduoe substantial

portione of the Introduction to my edition of the Andria of
Terence, publishcd by thern in 1901.
