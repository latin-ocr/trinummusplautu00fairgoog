but Lesbonicus will consent to the marriage only on condition
that a small piece of land, the last remnant of his fortune,
be taken for his sister's marriage-portion. This proposal
excites great alarrn on the part of Stasimus, the faithful .
slave of Lesbonicus, who does his best to dissuade Philto
from accepting the land.. Lysiteles himself pleads with Les·
¹ horricus not to persist in his folly‚ but the latter is obdurate.
= Meanwhile Callicles, who has learned from Stasimus what
is going on, confers with Megaronides, and together they
devise a plen for providing adower from the hidden treasnre
without exciting the suspicions of Lesbonicus. For a small
sum they hire a sycophantam pr'ofessional impostor, who is
η to pretend that he is amessenger from Charmides. He is
’ to bring with him letters, one of which, directed to Les-
,¹ bonicus, is 'to inform the young man that Charmides is send-
’ ing money to Callicles, to he used as a dower for h-is sister.
³ In reality, the money is to be dug up within the house.

By an extraordinary coincidence, Charmides, returning
unexpectedly from abroad, meets the impostor before his
¹5· own door. The scene, which is extremely amusing, ends
21, with the complete discomfiture of the impostor. Then
ἶ Stasimus appears and, recognizing his old master, informs
him cf all that has taken place in his absence, including the
» supposed treachery of Callicles who, however, in a few
'3 words explains his conduct to his old friend's satisfaction.
25⁸ Arrangements are now quiclrly made for the marriage. Les-
: boniensis forgiven and, at his father’s request, marries the
τ’ daughter of Callicles.
