xx INTRODUOTION

The shortened long may be (a) a monosyllable, (b) the long
syllable of an lambio word, (e) the first syllable of a dis·
syllable or polysyllabis word, (d) the second syllable of a
polysyllable. The following are examples from the Tri·
nemeaeus-

(o) 1111611) lu monn (104); qood ad velarem (482);

(ὁ) enim lu (61); oded (513); paler molto (361);

(e) 11116) istaec (77); hune) exturbasti (137); quod odibit
(249);

(d) dedistlue (129); sduietdfl’ (398) ; tobfvndeulo (726).

15. Other peculiarities of early Latin versificatiou are
the following:-

· 16. Final safter a shortvowel was weakly sounded and

therefore sueh an s, followed by a consonant, usually fails

to make positi0n; ey. pride quom (198), redeque (234), meeis

lubet (275).

17. Contrary to the later1·ule,a syllable ending in a
short vowel before a mute, followed by lor r, is not ‘ eom-
mon‚' but remains short3 ey. (tyro (616). ¹

18. Certain final syllables, whieh became short in laten
times, still retain in Plautus the original long quantity.
Thus :—

(a) -ᾱτ, -et, -lf, in many verb forms, as dfoaf, dicebat, dicet,
dlxiv, dieerif¹ ; ag. nyc‘d (842), hebel (206).

(b) dr and -or iu verbal forms, as dicen dfeor; and er and
-on in substantivas and comparative adjectivae, as
11111ιὲ1, orator, toeniam ef. exercitos (226).

(e) oeoasional eases like elie (971) are due to syllaba anceps
at a pause in the verse.

, (cl) eye as well as eqd is found in Plautus3 of. 173, 282.
’ 19. Even in planes where the iambie law does not apply,
the words ille aud nempe often show the apparent scansion

1But not (eo.) dicit, or futures in -e'l, eserie, amobit. v
