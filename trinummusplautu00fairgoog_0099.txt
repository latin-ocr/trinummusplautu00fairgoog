8. em: scel-nunciam: a trisyllable. This redundant ex·
pression is used by Livy (7. 32. 14), while iam nane, tom iam are ’

Ciceronian as well.

4. ne quis erret uestrum: te. lest you suppose us to be charae-
ters in the play itself ; uestrum = uestmm. -paucim se. uerbis. -
in uiam: into the right way ,¹ corresponding to erret, lose one’s way.

5. operam dare: to pite attention. Note the omission of the
subject accusative. The use of the infinitive present for the future
is frequent in eomedy, especially with dare and after promittere.
A Roman audience was apparently very noisy during the recital
of the prologue.

6. qua ego: semi-hiatus. Introduction, 524. -illaecz θὴρ,-
te. Inopia. - siet = εἰη the form is really an old optative, siem
= εἴην (Helm).

being partially retained—ei: a monosyllable. Introduction,

t 26. - qui me aleret: wherewitlt to maintoin me. In early Latin, ¹
qui is a common instrumental (or perhaps locative) form of the ,
relative, interrogative, or indefinite pronoun. Hence a variety ³

of uses. Here, qui = qao. The imperfect tense is used in oleret,
probably because esse relicui is the same as esse relietum, which
would allow secondary sequence, but in colloquial Latin there is
much freedom in the sequence of tenses—relicui: partitive
genitive, with nil. The word has four syllables in the older
literature, belng later reliquus.

15. quicum=quomm

te. sed: the statement already given would lead the hearer to
