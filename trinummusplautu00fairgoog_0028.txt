27. Inone respect a Latin comedy resembled a modern
opera A large proportiones each play was either sung or
recited to a musical aecompaniment. Scenes which were
merely spoken aud involved no musical clement were known
as diverbia These were the soenes composed in iambic
senarii.

28. Scenes into which a musical clement entered were of
two kinds. They were either (a) declaimed in recitative
style, with flute accompaniment, or (b) they were actually
sung to set tunes. Roth oi these kinds of sesnes were
known as cantico. The former (a) were composed either in
trochaic septenarii, iambic septenarii, or iambic octonarii.
The latter (b) were distinctly lyrioal scenas, composed in a
variety of meters, including not only' the more unusual
ones, but also those mentioned in connection with (a), the
merely recited cantica. .

29. The iambic (υ .) and trochaic (... υ), as well as
’ anapaestic (υ υ.), meters of Roman comedy take their
strict Latin names -e.9. senarius, septenarios, octonarius-
from the number oi individual feet which each line contains.
In Greek poetry, however, these measures are based upon
units of dipodies, or combinatione of two feet, whence a line
of tour feet is known as a dimeter, one of six feet as a tri-
meter, and so on. In an iambic dipody (υ - υ -) the
Greeks allowed the substitution of a spondes (. -) or a
dactyl (- υ υ) for an iambus only in the first half, just as
in a trochaic dipody (- υ - υ) the corresponding substitu-
tions of spondeo and anapaest (υ υ -) were allowed only in
the second half. The disregard of this rule, or the loss of
distinction between odd and even feet, constitutos the main
metrical difference between Latin and Greek comedy. In ’
