5. But assuming that Terence, dimidiatus 1110000101,ι
inirrors rnost faithfully the tone and easernble effect 01 110
N ew Α1110 Comedy, we cannot suppose, iu view 01 110 great
difference which the most superficial reader rnust deteet be-

tween him and Plautus, that the earlier writer strictly con· ’

fined himself to any one field. We must, indeed, believe

that in the Plautiue plays the author made use 01 011 110 ’
drarnatic resources within his reach. His literary activity 3

began toward the end 01 110 Second Punic Wer, and it was
shortly after 211 rac. that the Atellanoe² were introduced
into Rome. It is highly probable that these popular per-
101111011000 suggested to Plautus much 01 110 broad farce
and audacious roguery which fill bis plays. Horace, who
was no admirer 01 Plautus, 00110 hirn a very Dossennus

Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus in parasitis (Epist. 2. 1. 173)

and the 11011100 110011 01 110 author is by some derived 110111
another stock character in the Atellan farce, viz.: Maeona,

the buffoon. The careless haste to which Horace refers in ,

110 same passage —

Quam non adstricto percurrat pulpita 00000

10 probably due quite as much to the influence 01 1101110110

1 Terence is 00 styled by Julius Caesar, in an epigram which begins ε -

Tu quoque tu in summis, 0 dimidiate Menander,
Poneris, et merito, puri sermonis amator.

Menander was the chief representative 01 110 New Α1110 Comedy, which
fiourished 110111 about 336 110, (110 date 01 110 accession 01 Alexander the
Great) to 250 110. We possess only fragments 01 110 work, but recent
discoveries in Egypt have made very substantialadditions to these.

2 The fabulae 111011000010001101110111101110 from Atella, an Oscan town
in Campania. The Atellan 10100 set forth in burlesque the 1110 01 villagee,
aud at an early time 110 0101001010 followed fixed types. Maccus, 101011-

old rnan3 and Dossennus, a sly villain. Though the plots were pre-
arranged, the dialogue was largely improvised.
