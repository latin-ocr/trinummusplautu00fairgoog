ills, aeram cf. 131, 6723 328, 421. The probable explana·
tion is that, the words being atonis, their first syllable is
only ‘ half-long! Other words similarly treated by Plautus
are 1010, inde, uada (218), 001000. Another theory¹ is that
the final e could be disregarded3 ci. aec and aeque, sea and
aeoe; also tot(e) concilies (386).

20. Quantitative veakening¹ is seen also in 100010 (870),
quidquid (218), 110001ὀο0111 (623), and in wordcombinations
with the enclitio quidem, ag. dcimqaidem (58), quondoquidem
(352), and lcicqcs'dem (876). Thess words nray be com·
pared with tha classical bridio (= boe die) and 001101 (= quam
01).

21. es, from sum, is always long in Plautus,⁸ and the first
syllable oifleri, fierem, sta, at the end oi iarnbic and trochaic
verses is long. “

22. The pronoun (not the adverb) 110 is short. Similar

ara 10110 and illisas nominativos. The adjective 01001100
retains its original long 1 in 1130.

23. In words derived from the Greek, 01 (= χ) may
make position in Plautus. Thus the first syllable is long in
Actszns and Acheruns (cf. 525). The word Philippos, as
the name of a coin, accents the first syllable (as in the
Greek) and has the second syllable short, aq. at 152,1158.

combated by Radiord in articles on “ Tn'e Prosody 01 Ills‚'' in Amer. Jour.
