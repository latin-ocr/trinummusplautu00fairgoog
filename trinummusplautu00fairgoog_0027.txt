Similar is the case with the horrowed words aegina (725)
and satellites (833), in which the shortened second syllable
is due to the influence of accent.

24. Accented monosyllables,' ending in a long vowel or
a diphthong, are merely shortened before a following short
vowel or 10, cf. qai 1000οο (305), 000 cicc (430), 00 0000 (677), l
armoricana). So, too, accented monosyllables ending in
00 are not elided3 cf. 0000 eget (842), 0000 eqo (25). The
shortening cf c in such a componnd as 0000600000 (10) is
similar. This is called semi-hiatus, Ι

25. H1Arus. - Aside from the cases just given, hiatus is
very common in Plautus. It occurs 1 l
(1) after interjections3

(2) where there is a change of speaker53 · ,
(3) where there is a distinct elocutionary pause in the ¹

midst of a speech3¹

4) in the middle of a long verse, which is thus treated
as if made up of two independent verses3

(5) in certain cases which cannot well be classified. In
some of these the text is probably corrupt.

26. 8001010οῙ0, the settliay together, oi blending, of adja-
cent vowels of a word into one, is very frequent in Plautus,
a short vowel being regularly subordinated to a following
long, as in many pronominal forms3 cf. meo (81), iaec (117),

000· (46), tais (302), ei (14, 119), eoram (33), eosdem (295),
quoius (501), huius (795) Similarly, rei (119), deam (346,

355), dies (581), 00000000 (626), proinde (65), diot' truc (685),
dierecte (457 ).1

1 In synizcsis a dissyllable becomes a quasi-monosyllable‚ but the char·
aeter oi the first vowel is not wholly lost cr changed into a consonantal
one. Thus the Virgilian abiete (= abacta) is not, strictly speaking, an in·
stanceoisynizesis. For an elaborate discussion citha subject, seeRadicrd,
