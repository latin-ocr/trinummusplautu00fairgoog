23. meritam noxiam: ο fault decervinp (reproos); merdas has
an active meaning.

man no rewards (munera); immoene = immune, so moenia = munia,
munero,· cf. Poeni and Punicus, poeno and punire-in aetate:
at remea· literally, ¹⁶ in the course oi life.’'

ab. conducibile: profitable. Theword is rare outside of Plautus,
who is very iond oi adje'ctives in bilia-nam: implying some such
connection as: 1 have a reason for making this remark, sor, etc.
For the scansion, see Introduction, §24-

pounds in core.
