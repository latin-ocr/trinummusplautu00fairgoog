INTRODUOTION

alra AND WORK OF PLAUTUS

l. Ol the life of T. Maccius Plautus very little is known.

Cicero (De Senectute, 50) states that he was au old inan in
191 aa, when the Pseudolus was performed, and he died in
184 rao.

2. The poet was born at Sarsina, in Umbria, probably
about 254 uo. Going in early life to Rome, he is said to
have worked in some connection with the stage and then to
have invested his savings in foreign trade. Returning
penniless to Rome, he was employed as a laborer in a mill,
but found time to write playS, which won for him both
fame and profit¹

3. All the works of Plautus are palliatae (so. fabulae), le.
plays adopted from the Greek, so called because of the
Greek oloak (pallium) worn by the aetors.² Out of one hun-
dred and thirty plays once assigned to Plautus, the learned
Varro³ gave twentyone as belonging to Plautus consensu
omnium, and nineteen more as probably genuine. These
twenty-one, the sooalled fabulae Varrouu'auue, are, in all
probability tha twenty which have oome down to us, to-
gether with the Vidulurta, which was lost in the Middlo

l ¹Tneae bpre facts are elaborated by Sohar, Roman Poets os tlte Repub-
ic .158 .
llllith the palliatae are.oontrasted topatae, in which the soenes and
personages were Roman. These were later known as tabernariae (from
taberna, a shop) because ol their vulgar tone.
