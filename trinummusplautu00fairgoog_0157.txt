⁸5⁷. hoc: thus Lindsay, after A. The common reading is hcc

878. For hoece, Leo reads hisce. .

888. vixillum: Lindsay reads uexillum, ior which the form
uiuilium appears in certain inscriptions. In this case, ucxt‘ilum
could be rendered “a lable,'’ pinarium being an adjective.

901. Leo rejects this verse, regarding it as inserted in some
acting edition, so as to allow the omission oi vv. 928-949.

922. num Charmides? Leo reads euim Charmidea, making the
sycophant's reply begin with this remark. He also gives the
words dixi epo iam dudum tibi to the sycophant, and assumes a
lacuna before 924.

9³5. ac: the Mas. give atquc, which Leo retains taking it as a
monosyllable. For the objection to scanning utque cu- as an
anapaest‚ see Brix.

946-948. Thus Leo, who is responsible ior filling up the gaps
in 946 and 947.

97⁷. For rcchurmida, Ritschl thought it necessary to substitute
dechormidu and Brix echurmr‘do. More recent editors (including
Goetz-Schoell) retain the reading of the Mss

1018. For quio, Miiller proposes quinque (iiheiu. M ua. 54, 540).

1020. On these nemea, see Schmidt, Herm. 37, 362.

1036. strenuosos: Lindsay adopts Loewe's correction ot the
Mss. strenuos. Leo prefers strenuiores.

1112-1114. So Ritschl. The Mas. show the verses as fol· ι

lows.- Quamquam labores multos

Sed hic unus, ut ego suspicor, servat fidem.
Ob rem laborem eum ego cepisse censeo.

1123. quantumpoteat: supplied by Leo. Lindsay reads Eo. Sed
sores, making hoc sonim begin 1124, but this order would be un-
usual. See Prescot-t‚ Thnephi und Verse iu Plautus, in Ucia Colis.
Putl. Closs. Phil. Vol. Ι, ρ. 253.

1130-1131. Leo rejects these two verses. Lindsay reads uelit
foruelia.

1183. huius: due to Hermann. Accepted by Leo. Wacker-
nagel would read Calliclei (Archiv Lot. Lea. 14. 5.)

1188. optumumst: the Mss. give optumumst licet. Lindsay ¹

retains the former word; Leo, the latter.
