NOTES

ARGUMENTUM

This acrostio ammentum (statement oi plot), like similar
productione in other plays, was probably composed early in the
imperial period. lt is not the work oi Plautus.

1. thensaurum: arohaio iorm ior thesaurum (irom θησαυρὸς),
ινοαεανε, - abstrusum Ι abiens: the hiatus is probably an affected
arohaism, in imitation oi similar cases in the Plautine plays.

4. et = etiam ,· not a Plautina use.

5. poscitur: so. in matrimonium.

6. minus quo curn inuidia, eto: thot without odium Callicles
moy plue her u dolorm minus quo is used ior quo minore (inuidia).
For the scansion oi minus, see Introduction, 516.

7. mandat qui dicat: he commissione one to sum se. eum.

8. ut uenit: te. the messenger.

9. ut rediit: te. Charmides. - quoius nubunt liberi: his chil-
dren med. The liberi are the son and daughter oi Charmides.
For the plot, see Introduction, 546.

PROLOGUE

The prologues to the plays oi Plautus are, ior the most part,
spurious, having been composed ata time when the old plays
were revived ior the stage. The prologue to the Trinummua, ¹
however, is skilliully designed and may well be genuine. It is
the only one in which two speakers appear. l

1. hac: this woys- gnata=noto; this arohaio form is used
even by virgil-munus iungaris: sunyor always takes the ac-
cusative in Plautus. So too abutor, but utor and sruor take tho ab·
lative; potior takes accusative, ablativo, or genitive; vescor does
not ooour in Plautus.

2. finem: te. oi our journey. — quem dicam: indireet question.
