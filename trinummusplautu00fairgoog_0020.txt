popular entertainments as to the sordid motive which
the critic imputes to Plautus —

Gestit enim nummum in loculos demittere.

The verb percernere, which Horace applies in such a depre-
ciative way to Plautus, is curiously similar in meaning to
another, properare, used in a line where the context shows
that the characteristic referred to meets with approval.
Here, in his rapidity of movement (the precise force is
doubtful), Plautus is said to have taken Epicharmus¹ as a
model. There is no reason to doubt this statement, but we
may also bear in mind that Epicharmus, with all his refine-
ruent, was the representative of a dramatis field-Siciliam
comedy-which was ‘⁴ essentially burlesque,''² being the
direct ontgrowth of the rude Dorio farces.⁸ If we are
correct in assuming the presence of a large native clement
in the comedy of Plautus, it would be bui natural that his
plays, quite apert from any conscious imitation, should
resemble the comedies of Epicharmus.

indecorous demeanor, and apparent disregard of common
morality which many of his plays exhibit-is best cx·
plained by the merry abendon and unrestrained spirit of
frolic which characterized the rustic festivals oi the Ro
mans, and which may be compared with the Dionysiae
revels, in which Greek comedy had its origin.4 It is these
revels which account for much that is offensive to modern

1 Epicharmus, a Sicilian Greek, lived between 540 and 450 mc. He was
the first to introduce the drnukard and the parasite as dramatie types.

appeared certain stock characters, not unlike those in the Atellanae.
