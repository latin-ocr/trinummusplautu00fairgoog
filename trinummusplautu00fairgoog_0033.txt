42. The Adonic Dipody (L υ υ ΙΔ υ), familiar to us
from the Sepphic Stanza of Horace, is used in combinatiou
with other rhythms. Plautus resolves the long syllable into
two short ones. In the Trinummas this clausule is used with
Cretic Dimeters (248, 250) and also with lambio Dimeters,
instead of the Colon Reizianum (240, 247, 281).

1 So named from Reiz, a scholar who llved early in thenineteenth century.
