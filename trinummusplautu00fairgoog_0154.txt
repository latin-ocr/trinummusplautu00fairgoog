APPENDIX

The extant Mss. ot Plautus are ot two families. The only
representative oi one is the Codex Ambrosianus, known as A. ol
the fourth century aa, written in Capitals.¹ The other Mss.
belong to the Palatino family, which is known collectively as P,
and are written in minuscule script. The oldest belongs to the
end ol the tenth century.

In the following notes, we have cited all important variations
between the editions ot Leo (1896) and Lindsay (1903), as well as
the few cases where this edition accords with neither.

31-33. Thus Mss. Leo follows Bilchelerintransposing 32 and 33. ,

51. tuo opit: Leo with Α. Lindsay prefers opit tua, with P.

'ia-74. Leo rejects not only 72o (not given by Α), but also 73
and 74, partly because ot the use ot mores, and partly because these
verses interrupt the simile in aegrotant aud morbum.

85. qnod: so Mss. Leo reads qui aiter Scaliger.

96. Thus Lindsay, accepting the corrections oi Reiz and Bothe.

103. dici disnacior: this correction by Ritsohl oi the dicia
annucior ot the Mss. is accepted by Leo,

168. inscribit: Leo reads inscripsit aiter Nonius.

185. Skutsch proposes erne meam, etc, eme being (presumably)
the original form oi em (Philologus, 59, 500).

186. So Lindsay, adhering to A. Leo reads: hoscine propter
res maledicos sarnus serunt.

192. fil: Leo adheres to fiet ( ).

aaa-³00. Leo's arrangement ol this canticum is followed in this
edition. Foradiscussionof it,see Leo’s Die plantinisclren Cantica ,
und die hellenistisclre Lyrilr (Berlin, 1897).

238 a. Lindsay adheres to A, reading eos petil, eos sectatur.

2³9. Lindsay retains subdola blanditur.

¹Studemund’s famous apograph oi this Ms. has been consulted
throughout by the editor. ’
