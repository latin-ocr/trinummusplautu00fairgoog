bomne (320), 0101101010011 (464), milri 11110(477), tantam

13. In words oi four syllables having the first three short
(υ υ υ aa), the verse ictus (in accordante with the pronun-
ciation of 550 time) falls upon the first syllable in Plautus,
09. sdcilius, mdmlumia (331), 0100001101 (46), perierit (429);
cf. familiarem (89).ἱ Quadrisyllabic words with the scan-
sion (. υ υ sa) usually, in Plautus, take the ictus upon the
first syllable, ey. 5151111100(8), 010011100103), though some-
times upon the second, eg. imperiis (302).

14. Owing to the prominencs oi 550 0000115011 syllable,
adjacent long syllables are, in early Latin, treated as ‘half-
long'⁸ and scanned as either long or short. Thus iambic
(υ -) dissyllables could become pyrrhica (o o), and so
ego, 0151115105, amo, bene, mole,⁴ 050, 0501501100 55011
final syllables, which were originally long. This principle,
however, is not confined to single words, and we may lay
down 550 following 11110, viz.: that an unacceuted long
syllable may be shortened, when preceded by a short 0110,
and at the sarne time either preceded or followed by the
accent. This is called 550 lambio law, because the long

syllable thus affected naturally forms an iambus (υ .)
11155 550 preceding short. The short syllable preceding the
shortened long must be a monosyllable 01 begin a word.

flMany words, 01 course, 010 long enough to admit two accents, a
primary and 0 secondary.

⁸ Α ‘hali-long' syllable is defined by Professor Radford 010110 “ which
is normally long, bnt which the ear, nuder certain conditione, may measure
as 0 short '' (Amar. Jour. os Phil, vol. 27, p. 420).

⁴ But forms like polo, docte, 110101 show a final short.
